# Contributing guidelines

We welcome any contributions to `IMAS-Data-Mapping`, 
from an update on the mapping for a given experimental device, 
to feedback and comments from potential consumers of the mapped data.
Please first make sure you read and follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## You prepare data mappings for a given device and want to contribute to our list
1. fork the repository to your own Github profile and create your own feature branch off of the latest `main` commit. 
Make sure to regularly sync your branch with the latest commits from `main` (find instructions 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork));
2. when your update is ready, create a pull request (find instructions 
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)).


## You want to discuss about your mapping updates/issues or learn about the latest relevant IMAS changes
You can join the monthly meetings organized on Teams. 
To allow collaborators to join from various timezones we alternate between two slots:
- morning session on 2nd Wednesday of odd months at 9:00 CE(S)T
- afternoon session on 2nd Thursday of even months at 17:00 CE(S)T
Please send an email to <imas-administration@iter.org> to receive one or both of these regular invites 
as well as the link to attend remotely. 

You can also follow this public IMAS [google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=OTdlNmU3MTE1MDU2MjBmNGRlNjFjNWVmMDNkNGQzNTlmNTJlN2E3NGY1NDI2NTM1OTIxMTQyYTUyN2IwMzg0N0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t), or chat with us on the 
[#data-mapping channel on imasusers Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/imasusers/shared_invite/zt-1c25gg4d1-rpiKnfQjIVBTBrAn37x~yA).


## You want ask a question or raise a problem you found in a given dataset
1. use the [issue search](https://github.com/iterorganization/IMAS-Data-Mapping/issues)
to check if someone already created a similar issue;
2. if not, make a **new issue** to describe your problem or question. 
In the case of a bug suspiscion in the mapping, please try to give all the relevant 
information to allow reproducing the error or identifying its root cause (IDS, device, mapping tool, etc...);
3. tag the contact person for this device and apply relevant labels to the issue.


While we will try to answer questions quickly and to address issues in a timely 
manner, it can may sometimes take longer than expected. A friendly ping in the 
issue thread can help draw attention if you find that it was stalled, or you can join our regular meetings.
